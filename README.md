##StarterList
StarterList is an in-person tool for quickly gathering and distributing email addresses within a group. It allows users to create an on-the-fly custom URL where email addresses can be submitted. Once a predefined threshold is met it email-blasts the entire list *the entire list*.

###StarterList aims to:
* Eliminate data entry
* Reduce 'organizer' bottlenecks
* Speed up the process of taking a conversation online

###Project Goals:
To TDD a rails-based JSON API with a mobile-first frontend.
